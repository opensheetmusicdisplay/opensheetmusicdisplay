#!/bin/bash
# This script runs a visual regression test on all the images
# generated from OSMD samples (npm run generate:current and npm run generate:blessed)
#
#   inspired by and adapted from Vexflow's visual regression tests.
#
# Prerequisites: ImageMagick
#
# On OSX:   $ brew install imagemagick
# On Linux: $ apt-get install imagemagick
#
# Usage:
#
#
#  First generate the known good or previous state PNG images you want to compare to, e.g. the develop branch or last release:
#    (Server has to be running for this: npm start)
#
#    npm run generate:blessed
#
#  Make changes in OSMD, then generate your new images:
#
#    npm run generate:current
#
#  Run the regression tests against the blessed images in visual_regression/blessed.
#
#    npm run test:visual
#    # npm will navigate to the base folder automatically
#
#    # or: (this should be done from the main OSMD folder)
#    # sh test/Util/visual_regression.sh [imageBaseFolder] [sampleShellPrefix]
#    #    example: sh test/Util/visual_regression.sh ./visual_regression OSMD_function_test_
#    #        will run visual regression tests for all images matching OSMD_function_test_*.png.
#
#  Check visual_regression/diff/results.txt for results. This file is sorted
#  by PHASH difference (most different files on top.) The composite diff
#  images for failed tests (i.e., PHASH > 1.0) are stored in visual_regression/diff.
#
#  (If you are satisfied with the differences, copy *.png from visual_regression/current
#  into visual_regression/blessed, and submit your change (TODO))

# PNG viewer on OSX. Switch this to whatever your system uses.
# VIEWER=open

# Show images over this PHASH threshold. This is probably too low, but
# a good first pass.
THRESHOLD=0.01

# Set up Directories
#   It does not matter where this script is executed, as long as these folders are given correctly (and blessed/current have png images set up correctly)

# diff also acts as the temp folder here, unlike in Vexflow, where it is current.
# it would be nice to have a tmp folder (for temporary files), but we'd want to delete the folder entirely, and we'd better not risk using rm -rf in a script

# All results are stored here.
